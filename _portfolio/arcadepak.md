One of my longest running projects: A set of custom tracks for SRB2Kart, most of them being original but with a few of them being brought over from classic arcade racing games. Probably one of the few things that I've really dedicated a lot of my time (and have returned back to from time to time to keep working on).

[Latest version (v1.8) available for download here!](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/arcadepak-v1-8-double-trouble.2247/)

The following tracks are available here:

- **Virtua Circuit Zone**

A short but hectic 5-lapper with a simple layout but with a hectic energy from the item distribution, end shortcuts and JET WORLD blasting at full volume in your speakers.

And yes, I'm aware that it looks outdated nowadays (a bit too plain even for my usual "flat-colored" stuff); revamping this track would be cool one day if I ever figure out when to both do that and get on my Kart shenianigans once again.

Music: Mutsuhiko Izumi - Jet World (from DDR Extreme)

- **Snowdust Valley Zone**

A 3-lap track where you'll be flying together with the snow and the wind from the ramp and fan jumps, in a surprisingly (for what I often do) rounded out track with few shortcuts and clear racing lines. I've even seen some few Kart tournaments run this track; I'm so proud of this little guy getting that far :,)

Oh, and yes, the "Flying Together" part was a joke over that being the name of the song used. Thank Reelism for having me find out that song!

- Music: Firebird Phoenix - Flying Together

- **Mount Acres Circuit Short**

Another 5-lapper that I distinctly remember finsihing in a couple of days compared to antoher track I made before that took me months to finish. And it might show in that regard: It is doable with previous experience but there's definitely some few oddities with how its built, mostly because of how it was originally made as a double-feature track with a longer version that never returned for ArcadePak from back when it was standalone.

- Music: Super Monkey Ball 2 - Monkey Race (Beginner)

-- *Polychrome Polygon Zone**

Layout-wise is on the simpler side, but I remember having a blast with the visual design that wanted to take on the idea of a monochrome void like Kodachrome but add some extra color to it (as well as experiment more with the whole color shading stuff), hence Polychrome Polgyon.

This one used to have a weird underground bridge for most of the first versions until the (few) feedback I got from them unanimously advised to cut that thing away...so I did. And what you see is what you get!

Haven't been any layout changes to the track since then, which might be a possibility but only if I get to do a revamp over it. It still looks cool to me though, and its the one track where I recorded most of the building process for it.

- Music: Jazz Jackrabbit 2 - Jazz be Damned

- **Ridge Turnpike Zone**

LAST BONX

So I grab "Ridge Racer" and "Toad Turnpike" and slam their names together for something unrelated to both of these, and taking the idea of a half-ramp-tastic map with a short length but feeling like speeding all day, this track became a surprise favorite in the community just from how insane it can get with all the drifting needed. And on that note, it also happened to be one of the few tracks where I ended the most satisfied with visually!

- Music: Last Bronx - Cross Street (Tommy's Stage)

- **Tricolored Space Zone**

I know that the name is a bit on the...simpler side? But hey, at that time I definitely only had for theming "track with three colored sections" and currently that's what it still is. The Sonic CD music was a perfect fit for the weird motif though (and I'd also say the same about the background, but I can get from what I've been told about it being ocasionally if not majorly distracting for some).

Anyways, another 5-lapper of chaos, turns and drifts to be careful of, specially at the end with how abrupt it might be to take it properly. I've seen enough people fall off that one last turn when going off the ramp before it lol

A fun memory, maybe needs an overhaul...but you could say that a few tracks need one as well, and like those, whether I get on producing and finishing one is something I cannot promise on at all yet. But hey, if you enjoy this one as it is right now, then that's great!

(Because I still do, but can't really test most of my stuff online in most cases)

- Music: Sonic CD - Special Stage (Japan)

- **Dynamite Wilderness Zone**

Peak "lightning-in-a-bottle" status, a track that I revived from an unfinished track idea by using the half-pipe ramps I had used on it plus some clever trick in making a sort of loop/circle elevated hairpin that looks cool and feels cool to drive through at high speeds. Basically a brother to Ridge Turnpike Zone in vibes, textures, half-pipes and penchant for high-octane, high-speed, CADILLAC racing.

Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, anyone? C'mon, if you had a go at any of the golden classic Capcom beat-em-ups, you surely must have had a fun one when recognizing the music here.

- Music: Cadillacs and Dinosaurs - Roaring Sound (STAGE 3-A)

- **Backroom Velocity Zone**

Started as an April Fools joke track (originally was going to be full of boosters and almost if not entirely walled) only to develop into a normal track when starting to detail it visually...and yes, it was less intended to be "backroom-themed" from the get go, but instead the name came through after using my "flat-color-shading" technique for the map (once again) and then realizing how the pink void reminded me of that whole backroom stuff.

Anyways, 4-lapper (originally 3-lapper, but changed by request of other players) that's yet again a short burst of madness, three halfpipe turns with a deceptive pair of turns ahead of them (and a thin shortcut) then greeted with another big half-pipe and then your final turn into victory.

Also the music was pretty cool to find; some of VLIF's tunes really got that Bomberman Hero style baked on it.

- Music: VLIF - SIDEREAL (from Yohiko 4)

- **Meteor Desert Zone**

The last frontier, currently the last original track I've made for the track, and one that perhaps might show a bit about not having the greatest mood or time while making it from its sparse visual design.

But hey, shoutouts to the players that helped me test this layout-wise!

A 3-lapper with a tunnel filled with cuts, split paths and overall some room for creativity with how you try to approach the track between racing others and the few small shortcut ramps that could be used with a sneaker at hand. Not many meteors visible, but Kirby 64 having me think of the setting (And music) are to credit for that name.

- Music: Kirby 64 - Rock Star

***TO BE CONTINUED...***
When this gets updated again, the extra sections for VR Big Forest, RR Seaside Route 765 and the "lost" tracks (one hidden and one that got replaced) that I have to talk about will be here too. But for now, I'm a bit drained so I will get to that tomorrow. Might see if I spruce this up more in bells-and-whistles of presentation considering this is my own place now, but in any case, I hope you enjoy it!
