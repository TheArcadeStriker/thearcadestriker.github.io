<p>[This was written on Dec 26, 2023- it was a big of a long while between stuff happening lol]</p>
<p>Might have felt like a bit of an uneventful day on its own, but aside from stuff that I caught on youtube like the Super Mario Star World demo release (still haven't tried it), Boi Rocket's new Kart montage and HD Remaster - ZERO VS OMEGA DECISIVE BATTLE (60fps), but something that also happened was that a little puppy showed up out of nowhere inside my house...right after my mom was recently mentioning that she wanted to adopt a puppy. Funny how things happen, huh?</p>

                 <p>Episode 24: MERRY CHRISTMAS MOTHERF-</p>
<p>[This was written on Dec 26, 2023- it was a big of a long while between stuff happening lol]</p> 
<p>When the night rolled out, the salad and hallacas and all that stuff was ready- I wore my oldest shoes I got this year as the two pair of shoes I was gifted by my mom a few months ago unfortunately had issues: The first pair of red shoes got kinda detached and worn out- apparently had been for a few days, and the second pair I made a stupid mistake of ordering them 43 instead of 42 so they were too big to comfortably walk with for long roads, which is what I was going to need a bit later that night.</p>

<p>The dinner happened, some nice banter with my mom, middle brother, his friend, an ol' friend of mine () and even my father, with my brother's older friend and my other brother arriving late- we even joked a bit about my brother's apparent arrival in 15 minutes after an hour had passed.</p>  

<p>Nino showed up one hour before it started and could finally see my mom again, and had told her about the little reunion we were planning at another friend's house, so after the dinner and sitting for a bit, I walked off there and met up with the two other fellas.</p> 

<p>Another dinner later, where I was definitely going at it slower because of how I had taken one already, it was Secret Santa time.</p> 

<p>It started with "Cirno"'s gift for Nino- a poster of Honkai Star Rail, and both a keychain and a customized sticker of Pela from that game applied to his Xbox 360 wired controller. Guy was sitting there for like a whole minute speechless.</p> 

<p>Maggy's turn and he threw some Doritos Flaming Hot bags at Cirno.</p> 

<p>"Yeah dude, that's your gift, I had to gift you"</p> 

<p>And then after he really believed it, he pulled up a little green bag that was for me.</p>

<p>You got no idea how crazy it was to pull the HORNET FROM DAYTONA USA PAPERCRAFT OUT OF THE BAG. And then inside the bag, there were a bunch of stickers, a handful from stuff I know and like (Richter and Dracula, Initial D's Toyota AE86, two Hornet stickers and one's from Fighters Megamix, Mario, Luigi...even a sticker of Ronaldinho Soccer 64, beeg yoshi and THE GNOME), including two stickers from art HE MADE for me of my OCs. That was such a great detail :,)</p>  

<p>My turn rolled around and I said "this is what I could do in time- sorry" and showed Cirno a 20 second shitpost of Dr. Eggman. In the same folder of that file though, there was a nothing.mp4 file in my phone.</p>

<p>He opened it...and boom, music video to the tune of Sonic Speed Riders with some cutscenes from CD, Adventure 1, 2, Riders, Zero Gravity and Unleashed- with all the detail to making stuff fit with the beat as my "ADHD brain" (unconfirmed and undiagnosed...but with how some stuff described from it tend to fit me, its probable) would want stuff to stick to the rhythm. Then I showed him how I had originally set up the decoy video as a Youtube video from a burner account that would have the real deal as an end card, but since I didn't know if the internet connection was going to be reliable, I did the other thing first.</p>

<p>Finally, Nino gifted Maggy a drawing notebook, which he stated it was the first time he had a fully white notebook for that purpose, and Cirno pointed out that the notebook seems to be designed more for traditional Japanese painting with the texture of the sheets and the Japanese inscription from the outside...but in any case, yeah, as he said, "just what he needed".</p>

<p>The rest of the night was spent eating lemon pie and cake on the rooftop, while we talked about some random stuff and I was starting to kinda feel the effects of being awake for that long while Nino had brought some Ponche Crema (cream punch, Trinidad ponche-de-creme, whatever y'all call it) which amusingly enough was called "Ponche Crema de la Jefa" and at first we all took it as it was a bottle given to him by his boss...but my brother later mentioned that it was the name of the drink they sold lol</p>

<p>Around 2AM, it was time for my brother to pick me up and finally could shut some eye home after a long but eventful night.</p>

                 <p>Episode 23: Beach tennis ballin</p>
<p>Not whoisthisgit- good channel tho, but Github...because as of writing this, you are probably going to see this on Github now instead of Neocities AS LONG AS THEY HAVEN'T FIXED MY SITE YET- WHICH THEY HAVEN'T. But at least I just redid a tiny bit of the original index HTML which wasn't much outside of a little landing page and Battle Hunter music. Blog and About Me will be a different beast altogether, at least for now...</p>

<p>Imagine being stuck in your own home because a hobo took off with your house keys out of nowhere...that literally happened today to a friend and when I arrived with my brother to go fetch some beers to bring home for my mom for the soon to come Christmas...he was still stuck, but not too long after we arrived, the guy came back with the keys and he was free wheeeee</p>

<p>That ol' friend Suzuki spawned again to summon me on the plaza alongside other old high school friends for some beach tennis...and I haven't gone there yet as of writing this but I am looking forward to that. Also, first time having a proper bottle of Polar beer, and only one because I gotta go to that 6PM tennis beach thing with my sanity intact, as the last time I had been near a bottle of beer it was literally one beer we had to split between my brother, me and our friend as we somehow only ended up with enough to buy a single bottle- that's a funny long story that I should get to write about properly one day.</p>

<p>So eventually I did go to the plaza...and while I saw those good ol' high school buddies waiting, the one that had summoned us had arrived a bit late to the place...and lost his reservation due to that. Thankfully, one of the invited had an idea to go to a different place that also had beach tennis, even though it was a fair bit more far away, also thanks to another guy's contact to take up there. And with that, we were set for some beach tennis ballin'</p>

<p>I definitely was a beginner at it along with "R" as both of us hadn't played that before, as Suzuki also hadn't tried that as much before but picked it up fast, and the other three clearly had some experience with that before. But it still was really funny to see some flips and flops, some wins and some losses, and for me, it was priceless to occasionally NOT fumble receiving the first serve and getting an immediate point a few times from those.</p>

<p>Oh, and make sure to think on the safety of your socks if you care about them, because running on the sand as you try to get used to that might wear them out a bit.</p>

<p>As 9PM arrived, we were out of there and back to the plaza where we met, splitting up with three of 'em while me, Suzuki and the good guy R (you know who you are...and you also know why you're only mentioned like this lol) had went to end the night with some pizza while talking about what we had been up to recently, whether when we could plan something once again these days before Suzuki has to go again, and even talking about the hilarious shit that happened to us in Lethal Company such as experiencing how proximity chat makes for a horror comedy moment from having your rambunctious squad suddenly shut up when they were nearby (oh dear they are gone, aren't they?), laser dinosaur and giants moments, and people dying from trying to rescue another assumingly alive player or to fetch their corpse with their loot back to the spaceship only to eat lead on the way.</p>
<p>Those two pals walked me back home and it was all a pretty chill night all things considered, even if surprising to think that they were doing all that and I was back home at a whopping 10:40PM with both of 'em, but it was a really fun experience overall.</p>

<p>The hallacas are also finally done for this CHRRRRRISTMAASSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>

<p>Aaaaaand the Secret Santa thing I got to speedrun as soon as possible before tomorrow night arrives...bruh</p>

<p>I eventually did...and also was a goofy idiot at 3AM laughing at Golgo 13 panels in just two of the first chapters I've ever read due to that snazzy Namco light-gun game I discovered based off it and that I haven't tried in MAME yet.</p>

                 <p>Episode 22: Bloc de notas</p>
<p>Reference to me writing this on the Notepad right now because as of writing this, the Neocities site is still down since two days ago, so I have to fiddle with the only backup I had made of the site which happened to be the journal. [EDIT] Whoops, I forgot to write too about today, but </p>
</details>

                 <h1>THE NEOCITIES INCIDENT</h1>
<p>Well...this was the day where my site temporarily went down due to a mistake on the system- and as of writing this, is STILL down, and I'm logging this here over a local copy I made of this specific Journal HTML page before the error logged me out of the account and currently has me locked out with the site being not found. Hopefully it will be fixed in under a week, but by the time you are reading this...it will either be up again and you'll be here from reading the homepage tidbit mentioning this, or you might happen to be reading this on the Github page trying to reconstruct this site from scratch if it doesn't come back.</p>

                 <p>Episode 20: Obvio Microbio. It sounds like something from a show, right? But it's just a little play of words lol</p>
                
                 <p>The summary from the long, long day of today as I'm writing this at 7pm is that after a nice breakfast with some sandwiches I made with tomato, onions and cheese, then another pasta lunch from my brother, the rest of the day was basically doing a lot of cleaning on the rooms...a LOT of cleaning. There was a lot of moving around stuff since my mother was getting her stuff from the room I was occupying the entire year she was absent moved into the empty room that used to be my first brother's room until he also was kinda absent since last year too because he had moved and was living there instead while taking a lot of time fixing stuff on his little new castle.</p>
                
                 <p>Its kind of scary how you don't discover the real places where the dust settles until someone that has enough experience guides you to find those atrociously dusty spots, but on the upside...the home had never been cleaner, both thanks to stuff that needed to get reordered for a long time finally getting reordered, and finding the right cleaner to wipe the stuff on the floor in a few spots.</p>
                
                 <p>...It has been a very, VERY long day, but the results were very much worth it.</p>
                 
                 <p>In unrelated news, the addenum I wrote today for the day before this was kinda sizeable but I bring it up because its funny that I thought on writing so many details about stuff I remembered because of getting reminded of 4kids and such, but it happens to be a little goofy anecdote stowed as a DLC for yesterday that started from mentioning DBZ and Saint Seiya airing on a channel at 12am.</p>
                 
                 <p>Also unrelated but if you can get to play MICE ROBBERY CHICANERY SIMULATOR aka ChuChu Rocket with friends, then PLEAAAASE do it if you are able to convince them to try it. I haven't done that succesfully again in like...TWO times I've actually done that IRL, but I can guess that it would be really funny and worth it if you did and your friends are down for the idea.</p>
                 
                 <p>Maybe tomorrow I'll have my battle station of a desktop in the room as I had it on the desk outside between the cleaning up duties and also the Windows-installing duty of a cousin-who-I-call-uncle-because-he's-way-older-than-me who tasked me with that and his PC is also on the desk, so it was less silly to copy and paste stuff between computers with the USB drive when they were next to each other.</p>
                 
                 <p>Oh, and surpise surprise: DNF Duel is actually being given away for free TODAY on Epic Games Store. By the time you read this though it is likely not going to be available anymore, but I'm leaving this as a little tidbit of how I stumbled upon that by mere chance and absolutely took it because it might as well be the only way I would be getting the game lol</p>

                 <details><summary>The big return day</summary>
                 
                 <p>Despite how I basically stayed awake until 6-7am last night, this still was one of the best mornings I've had this entire year because of my mother finally arriving home again after a year long trip, being able to hug her again and sit down for like an hour with my other brother listening to some of her tales about how that trip to Colombia went; both funny memories from a niece being a little energetic gremlin despite being 4 years old and sometimes repeating bad words she hears from other people, to something like getting scared by a police dog jumping over her to sniff the guy that happened to be sitting right next to her who not only stunk like "the funny salt" but also happened to have a stash in his bag that was what the dog immediately went for (and no, I'm not making this up; the fact I'm actually hearing something like this from someone's experience when RETURNING IN THE BUS FROM COLOMBIA is kind of surreal). Oh, and apparently there were two moments where they were taking kids to the plaza only to turn around and leave somewhere else because of people consuming weird stuff, including one moment where they had to tell that little 4 year old niece that was with them that a man that was doing the "Pinkman flying into the screen special" in a plaza (if you know, you know- I can't believe she actually saw someone doing that irl) that he was injecting a serum for pain...and thankfully she just shrugged it off as easily as that.</p>
                 
                 <p>My second brother also had some nice plans with cooking some nice rice with meat for lunch.</p>
                
                 <p>An old buddy also came by to pick up the piece of cake he didn't get from John Silver's celebration when he left that Smash Ultimate friendlies day event that you can see the exact date of if you find it down there in the journal, but basically he left early and thus wasn't able to be when the cake was split. Buuut I had kept his piece safe, thankfully with a neat trick frmo keeping three pieces of cake as an offer for "the orcas" that are my two brothers to keep that one safe, and had some three cookies with it to sweeten the little deal knowing that he basically waited two days for a cake he skipped by accident lol</p>
                 
                 <p>Oh yeah, and there's something that's open now: THE BLOG PAGEEEEEEE WOOOOOO- and the first thing that's inaugurating this new section of the website is none other than a tweaked/condensed/revised version of the first part of SRB2Kart The Documentary...actually available to read <a href="https://arcadestriker.neocities.org/blog/kartdoc/kartdoc-part1" class="keychainify-checked">right here in the website- and also as a VIDEO!!</a></li> It seems like this Neocities setup even when it is all a bit more manual with the HTML and such, it can be more entertaining to do stuff with and don't have to wrestle with ads or lack of a dark theme that I like for the Wordpress site.</p>
                 
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong>That night I slept at 1am in my second brother's room as, after checking some stuff later in the PC, he messaged me that the WB channel was airing THE ORIGINAL DRAGON BALL Z LATIN AMERICAN DUB, and without any censors, so I showed up there to take a look and ended up watching the tail end of Episode 75 ("Password is Porunga"...what a silly name) and Episode 76 ("Piccolo's Return"- too bad they didn't return him to the right place lol) while also mayyybe watching the original ending of that anime in full for the first time, since back when they aired it in other channels here, the ending was always sped up so the full song never played. </p><p>After those two episodes, they also aired Saint Seiya (for us, Caballeros del Zodiaco, which means Knights of the Zodiac, the name you likely now it as, in Spanish) Episode 38, where Aioria kicks Seiya in the floor until a soap opera starts with not Athena (but wait...SHE IS) telling him that his brother was no traitor, with a convenient flashback to the truth in that moment, and then Seiya lobs Aioria's Fire Capsule attack at him after the past few moments dodging it with the golden armor and then getting hit by it once. It was kinda funny to see all of that play without any previous context along with the faceless big bad gray hair guy responsible for fooling that goofball...but hey, if you ask me, it is still cool that they air something that old even if it is so late at night, mostly thanks to how popular this anime was back in the day unlike the surprisingly lukewarm era that apparently the 90s were for anime in America. </p> <p>I know I definitely watched a video mentioning Latin America and their earlier adoption of anime compared to the US because of how they were basically animated soap operas in some cases (and if you somehow don't know, those were HUGE here- I actually knew of Tony Dalton, who you very likely know today for Lalo Salamanca, like a decade ago because he showed up as the antagonist Rafael Urrieta in Flor Salvaje, a show that my mom watched A LOT so I had a knowledge of his striking appearance- minus his signature moustache) but I cannot remember the name of the video, though I might find it as I vaguely remember that being brought up only to compare the often uncensored renditions of anime exported there compared to the very altered 4kids dubs in US- except for any anime that they had the rights for to localize (so no, we didn't get Yu-Gi-Oh where you died instead of Shadow Realm moment and WE ARE in One Piece...though I am still fond of the opening rap because of how it sounds in the Latin American version and the US-exclusive One Piece Grand Adventure- still haven't played that game in a while but I remember playing the living devil fruit of that with my brothers...way before I knew of Power Stone and how that game was basically the foundation for those kind of games.</p><p>Oh, and almost forgot to mention how before I even got that message about DBZ on the TV, I stumbled upon a tweet of No Context International Dubs with that infamous DBZ Kai ending that was literally sped up and the song could play for only 10 SECONDS. Yeah, I remember that clearly, Cartoon Network.</p>

                 <p>I'm writing this later at 5pm instead of early in the morning because of, aside from a 3 hour power outage, I was cleaning home as today was the day my mother would arrive from a long trip back home...but so far it seems that the bus had an accident in another city and thus will be arriving tomorrow in the morning instead of tonight...but from what she said, at least it seems that she's already in the country and fine.</p>
                 
                 <p>It was nice to do a lot of progress with cleaining though, as well as how I was doing most of the sweeping and such while listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ3nZlcSjYc" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">UK Garage & House Classics Mix - 1997 - Part 1 - Mixed by Chris Renegade</a>; what an amazing selection of songs- I actually think I remember stumbling upon this one months ago while I had to crouch near the water pipe at the corner outside of my house to fill up water through bottles when there was a missing connection to properly seat the water pump into the pipe, so I think I held it still with the legs while I used my free hands to pick up the bottles while listening to music as it would be a bit of a while to fill up enough to have for the next days...</p>
                 
                 <p>Thankfully not too long after that, the water pump was properly seated thanks to a brother's friend help and soon after that, it seems that the city's water pump on my area got fixed which means that I actually can get to fill the water storage tank and the two cooler bottles we have for consumption with a hose. So many trips having to go some squares down nearby my dad's home to fill up from water in the urbanization there now saved, as well as time from being able to fill up stuff quickly. Listening to that same mix I used to back then and then realize that it was the same as back then really gave me a flashbang of a flashback. Time sure flies, huh?</p>
                 
                 <p>In other news, its already 3AM so this is technically from December 19th, but...hey, I finally figured out how to make the site display much more responsively on phones; thanks to <a href="https://dannarchy.com/tut/tut_001" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked"> this tutorial</a> to make the contents be responsive and stay inside the container even when on a phone, and <a href="https://embedresponsively.com/" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">this tool</a> for being able to create responsive video embeds. It actually makes me feel more comfortable now to share stuff I write here in the future whenever I get to migrating WordPress posts and brand new content to this little hut of mine. Hours ago I was able to play for a good while online in BallisticNG from one of Radracer's Multiplayer Mondays; coincidentally it seemed that this one was the last one of the year as the next monday is Christmas, so I was lucky to be able to play today even though I was dead last in most races.</p>
                 
                 <p>Almost forgot that I actually finished the actual last two episodes of that thing from before, and while it was OkayChamp that not only things actually got resolved but that it was at least more stupid than usual to make it entertaining while watching it with my brother, that little post-credits sure is telling that a second season was planned all along. I get the reason of the poor reputation it has online, specially when it is definitely not something that you would say fits on the franchise's image with how it is pretty much its own thing using the names and modified designs of the original...but I guess that maybe between our microwaved sense of humor due to stuff like Dross, El Bananero and YTPs, watching it with my brother in the first place who also had a lot of laughs and enjoyed it after being himself the one who wanted to do it (because at the time when he asked me about it, I was very hestitant after the reputation it had and he insisted to watch it anyways instead of caring about the reviews), and I guess that also imagining that there's more boring stuff out there that I wouldn't want to watch like Slippin Jimmy (who thought on creating Big Mouth but with kid Saul was a good idea- if you ask me, my brother has NOT asked me about this thing's existence so far)...I would say that it wasn't insufferable as I had imagined it would be outside of one episode being a bit too grating on its already on-the-nose script. At least for me.</p>

                 <p>Oh yeah and my brothers and me did some more massive cleanup home to prepare for the big return...</p>

                 <details><summary>I executed the Smash Ultimate friendlies at home...and ended so exhausted I actually didn't get to write that much the very day it happened</summary>
                 <p>Oh dear, I still feel like there's stuff to clean and move before the gang arrives in one or two hours for the Smash Ultimate session that was conjured by my friend that wanted to celebrate his birthday party with us this weekend.</p>
                 
                 <p>THIS WAS WRITTEN AFTER THE DAY BUT I WAS BASICALLY FALLING OVER ASLEEP AFTER ALL WAS SAID AND DONE...that was exhausting, though it sounded like people enjoyed it after all. The quick summary is that people arrived, we played a bunch of friendlies, one Switch with 7-8 players and the other one with just 1v1s, and then two minitournaments were conducted for everyone to play: First one was a single elimination single player and then the other one was single elim duos. I got the boot on the first one first round against a Cloud player because I chose Mario who I know he's very versatile...but he has better chance of killing if you know how to combo which I don't really know to do outside of attempting to do uptilts and up-airs, unlike Dr. Mario which I prefer despite his weak recovery because he bonks hard with single hits. Second tournament I got paired with John Silver and we barely survived the first round against </p>

                 <details><summary>More Counter-Strike and using collapsible stuff on the site</summary>
                 <p>Well, bury my shell at wounded knee- I actually was kind of awake overnight until 7am because of something I wanted to try with the website again and then for some reason was thinking like if I had my thoughts kind of fresh in the morning...though at least it seems that I was able to get some hours of rest after that.</p>
                 
                 <p>It was a huge relief that my brother was in a great mood and had already prepped some lunch to watch something with me; was somewhat concerned about how my afternoon would be after having not rested until the actual morning.</p>
                 
                 <p>Watched 1x7 of that show and...well alright, it was kinda funny between the chase reference and the switcheroos and such; I guess that it is interesting there's some more development than usual for that thing, though it makes sense that it is when the last one is the next one. Forgot to mention that two days ago I saw the one before that and that zoom-in on "it would be lazy to not resolve this" at the end of that did not go unnoticed- it definitely sounds stupid but you can guess that I would definitely believe that being an intentional wizard-did-it moment without even an excuse.</p>
                 
                 <p>Oh, and since I learned to do the details/summary thing for collapsible elements, I've been looking into implementing that for the past entries knowing some of them are preeeetty wordy, so that it is not a long travel to scroll down all at once. And also because it looks cool; HTML things you learn to love with Neocities, you know.</p>
                 
                 <p>The Xband music I used for this site really fits with the beeg Yoshi and it still looks so funny whenever I preview only to see the patted Yoshi with similar sounds on the music playing.</p>
                 
                 <p>Tonight played once again Counter Strike with friends and the aim_legocity map came up once again, which was funny, if I hadn't spent most of that round missing the headshots. Then we tried a funny but cool Sonic-themed map...and then a Silent Hill theme map that kinda freaked me out with the ambience, screams when some other shmuck opened something they shouldn't, and how big it was to the point that I was nervous until I could find another player to shoot down.</p>
                 
                 <p>Also had watched 1x8 of that one thing and...huh, it wasn't the last one. On one hand, it was neat to see at least one plot point mostly solved, but on the other hand, my guess from handwaving that previous episode question was correct. And the type of humor it has is still what it is (and I mean that because it does have an audience, or at least there's people that could tolerate even if can tell the way it intentionally makes thins obvious...though I know well that it doesn't sit well with many out there on the internet; specially people attached to the original IP which I can definitely get. I've seen similar stuff about Castlevania Nocturne except that has ben more split than universally despised and I'd say it is because of the following the original Netflix show had).</p>
                 
                 <p>Now I'm actually anxious over how soon, someone in particular will finally arrive in a few days here since last December...</p>

                 <p>LuigiBlood casually finding a video with a clip of Super Mario 64's cut multiplayer WITH LUIGI  <a href="https://twitter.com/LuigiBlood/status/1735675542517494082" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">on a new Spaceworld 95 video.</a> Crazy that something like this resurfaced AFTER the model resurfaced from a leak, which is infinitely less likely to have happened before a random video with a snippet of that idea was shown in some old footage...but that's how things happen sometimes, huh?</p>
                 
                 <p>Started doing some Kart-related stuff that would to in this site; right now its basically cleaning up the articles I had written on the wordpress site to post here along with formatting the interview with KartKrew in text form to make it available here as I hadn't published a text version since I published that video</p>
                 
                 <p>Played CS 1.6 again with friends late at night and then some Windjammers + KOF 98 with another friend...and since then, its 3am and I should have gone to sleep to avoid intrusive thoughts but I haven't yet- oh good grief...</p>
                 
                 
                    <p><strong>[REPLACED ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong>I had originally written a lengthy but collapsible vent here that night, taking the chance that this is a little corner of mine and journal where I wouldn't feel pressed by it, and it was something to write down all that to blow steam off from my diminishing mood that night...but as that past me guessed, I would likely just sweep it under the rug or store the end result somewhere else whenever I felt better due to how it might look like unwarranted rambling even if hidden behind a collapsible button. That, and likely also being paranoid of someone that would want to attempt some mockery by weaponinzing that. Not destroyed...but stowed away somwhere else</p>

                    <p>More work on THE GALLERY, currently on the Single Player Gallery with the index of my best times in racing games and such, but likely will get to other parts of it sooner than later.</p>
                    
                    <p>Also played Atomic Bomberman online once again with someone that summoned me on Discord after a few month, and soon after that I went with a friend to get the wired Xbox 360 controller he ordered online. He looked real happy about it, specially after testing it with Dead Cells which he always wanted to do!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Fell asleep again after playing CS1.6 again with ol' friends and then trying to go to sleep while listening to Karl Jobst's most recent upload as of writing this, which is his response to TC's response to his video about the magic trick of stashing charity money into an account for years until he and Muta caught him.</p>

                    <p>Finally started cooking a new page for the site...or at least currently, an index for a subset of pages that will be contained inside THE GALLERY.</p>
                    
                    <p>After one or two days with the cat also meowing a lot for the chicken in the fridge, he finally got his winner winner chicken lunch not dinner...and after that, he's still meowing for more bruh</p>
                    
                    <p>And just now I had winner winner chicken dinner, along with my brother who cooked it, his shepherd friend and my dad; had a taste of some homemade spicy sauce they bought and AHHH yeah that felt quite spicy even with a tiny bit. I know that must be burning hell in your tongue if you add a bit too much when my spicy sauce loving brother says that "its powerful...that's cool!"</p>
                    
                    <p>it was neat to take a fresh breath at the table and just enjoy instead of having the plate with me while checking or doing whatever on the computer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Got carried away after that between trying to list some stuff from the channel into an Excel file preparing for something site-related and more cleaning music albums frmo my mom on the shelves.</p>
                    
                    <p>Wathed Velma 1x5, was funnier than the previous one even if Velma was definitely being a real annoyance over trying to summon Norville as her personal mystery assistant and clown after he met someone else.</p>
                    
                    <p>The final thing I did for tonight was that some friends summoned me for Lethal Company for the first time...and now I see why it has blown up with people online as it did.</p>

                 <details><summary>Meeting some old friends again</summary>
                    <p>I finished the thing from last night in the morning: A gift to that John Silver friend I mentioned the day before that had his birthday. Yet another edited video like I have actually done recently this year for other gifts; this one being themed with the Garou intro music and style of the logo. A good while ago I played a handful of long sets with him on that game and the intro dynamic including the music was great enough to use as a base. I also finished writing something about  <a href="https://peakd.com/hive-140217/@acstriker/the-wonders-of-gaming-together-multiplayer-and-more-engesp" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">the wonders of gaming together, multiplayer or not</a>; hoping that it goes better than what I did before that...</p>
                
                    <p>I got to show it to him as I summoned him once again alongside other high school friends since one of them, which I used to play Smash Bros. a lot with and was one of "our gang" before he had left to another city due to studies...returned today. And as the two friends I often saw were also sitting with THREE faces I hadn't seen for a real good while, it was really fun to talk and listen to this banter about little things like the ups and downs of our studies and what we were up to now; it was impressive to see one of them show up. Of course, I'm looking forward to doing something this weekend with them taking the chance that ol' Suzuki is back in town and that I also wanted to let John Silver have a birthday party with us since he was with his family yesterday.</p>
                    
                    <p>On one hand, it was quite interesting to revive some old tales from high school once again from people that likely had those memories even fresher while also talking about how odd it was that most of what we learned there...didn't actually stick with us since we took off to university. It was a good day overall, even though there was one moment where...the summary is that someone that happened to be there unrelated to the rest had some odd stories to tell while we were on the same room.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ain't explaining that any further, but leaving this here as a self-reminder that THAT happened. Now I get how my brother feels when he also tells me his own little stories about that same thing happening to him.</p>
                    
                    <p>After all was said and done for the night, I took my old pal's advice from before to dedicate some time to cleaning up the old books in the drawer; all while listening to  <a href="https://youtu.be/XUNqhBRtOzA?si=Cc0N4P2dEynysD-R" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Relaxing Gran Turismo Music to help you focus</a>. It was kind of interesting though also odd in a few moments to see old movie and music boxes of stuff I vaguely or clearly remembered...and also saw that there was a disc of EL ZANCUDO LOCO DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUUUUUDUDUDUDDDDDUDUDU</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh, and aside from having a brief chat with AG_SunDev after a good while, I booted up Burnout 3 again after months...and hoo boy, it is still as good as ever.</p>
                    
                    <p>Also watched Velma 1x4 with my brother as he usually requests recently (forgot to write yesterday or the day before that I watched 1x3 too; that one was funnier to me than this one, though I know that it won't sound like much if not anything at all to anyone reading this); this episode was definitely way more on the nose than the other ones and didn't have as many dumb funny moments that had me or him laughing, so I think that the flaws many perceive with this show were getting to even me because of how there wasn't much that offset the super obvious commentary and tropes of it. Kind of ironic though how Norville being the most grating on that episode overall is also what ended up making for an oddly wholesome mini post-credits scene at the end that helped a tiny bit after the underwhelming but expected cut to credits before that.</p>

                    <p>Spent most of the evening with a friend that showed up to tag along while he went to visit another friend, and then all three of us went to a bakery...and then another one showed up there. The rest was talking silly stuff while walking to places, getting back home to one of their homes and also visiting ol' John Silver as he lived very close to where we had arrived, which prompted that we also stayed sitting for a good while talking and joking about more random things. I found out from him that Thor's next movie is gonna have the director of Rogue One instead of Taika Waititi...and while I don't know how much faith Marvel fans have left at this point, it sounds like a promising little change that they were self-aware of needing a change on that regard.</p>
                    
                    <p>What I was doing in the morning and later at night...you'll likely hear from me about that soon :)</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> I fell asleep kinda fast last night so I forgot to write down here some words of wisdom a friend had left me with that night: Make sure to find something that can really keep you fulfilled over the day outside of the computer, and aside from helping your mood by knowing you are doing progress on something, if you end up having less free time for THE GAME because of that...you'll actually enjoy more spending it into that because "you earned the break".

                 <details><summary><strong>The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tournament day...</strong></summary>
                    <p>Woke up early to go to the MK8DX event...and the tournament actually started a few hours later, but could play a handful of practice races and some friendly sparring with Atomic Commander in Smash Ultimate during that time.</p>
                    
                    <p>First round time: 4 Grand Prix cups with the total of points being the final result to have two out of the four players go to the next round. Swept with 209 points.</p>
                    
                    <p>Second round, was going head to head with a guy named Xuxo, and was kinda tight but also a lot of fun; also made it fairly well.</p>
                    
                    <p>Third round is where things got hectic, as I got paired with that same Xuxo, my friend Atomic Commander, and ShantaeLD; who my friend said that he looked like a beast playing Mario Kart and I knew from before as he often was at Top 3 of the Melee tournaments here. And sure enough, those were the tightest Mario Kart races I've ever had in my life, even when applying my knowledge of drifting inward in curves for extra speed frmo other arcade racers and SRB2Kart. Was screaming of joy when I saw I had managed to safely secure a second place to go into the finals.</p>
                    
                    <p>There even were some hilarious moments there, like Atomic Commander saving ShantaeLD from a BLUE SHELL in 3DS Koopa City because he happened to pass nearby the other player with a Super Horn and used it to avoid his own death from the explosion radius that would have caused, falling off the first shortcut with Shantae in Toad Harbor becaue on the first and third lap I bumped him during that tiny bridge...which resulted in both of us going down in the third lap, and the last race of those semifinals where I landed a TRIPLE KILL with a Bob-Omb hitting the three other players trailing behind me in GBA Mario Circuit.</p>
                
                    <p>After a long pause from the cosplay contest starting and ending though, the finals started, and I was against a stacked trio of players...which unfortunately resulted in me losing any possible lead and chance to catch up when the margin of error was basically gone and I kept choking with little mistakes that added up terribly or I kept getting karted on the final lap of each race without realizing it was the final lap. So...yeah, got Top 4, but I missed out on being Top 3 by like 20 points and still in 4th place on the total 12-player ranking of the games, since the tournament was being played ALWAYS with Hard CPU bots enabled.</p>
                    
                    <p>But the whole thing overall was really fun, and was able to drown that sour taste of choking so hard on the final stretch thanks to my three friends tagging along, specially after how I could eat Chinese Rice for the first time with them after YEARS since the last time I had seen a plate with that in my hands, as they wanted to visit a new restaurant they had heard of. It was extra cool as well to see one of my friends (CirnoBakaka) with a surprising hair cut talking with clear expertise about the details of the skill it takes for cooking chinese rice properly, as well as talking to my other friend about the ordeal of heating shrimps from your refrigerator and how he considers cooking fish easier to do properly than cooking meat, since overcooking meat has a higher probability of happening and avoiding that requires some calculations depending of the size of the portions served and such...so despite how cooking fish can be more complicated and he says that he finds it a hassle, he considers that those also end up being the best thing he can cook because of how overcooking fish is much less likely.</p>
                    
                    <p>He sure really showed the results from his 3 years under that chef course he had been struggling through since then.</p>
                    
                    <p>I could chat about it a bit with my older brother, which couldn't go to the event because he had a power outage and no mobile signal during that where he was...and said he was bummed that he missed out on it after he saw some photos from the cosplay event  as he missed the chance to take photos with some of the cosplayers (lol).</p>
                    
                    <p>In other news, I wrapped up writing a little thing about <a href="https://peakd.com/hive-140217/@acstriker/thrill-drive-3-the-racer-where-you-fear-for-your-life-engesp" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Thrill Drive 3</a>, though I would definitely consider giving this one a full blogpost on my Wordpress site with whatever other stuff I could talk or document about it (specially about the emulation setup, as the resources for that are kinda split in different places for some reason, and the first one you might find is kinda outdated)...or if I were to get that ambitious, maybe even its own HTML-and-everything page in this very site. Though that last thing might be more unlikely because as of writing this, I have yet to create a wholly new page for other stuff of mine aside from the Home/Journal/About Me pages available at the moment.</p>
                    
                     <p>And speaking of that game, it turns out that I'm not the first person to <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/ooiBUvd3_Bk?si=0sn78PlamFt3HzKs" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">meme this game in a video.</a></p>
                     
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Also ended up playing Counter Strike 1.6 with some old friends I hadn't played in months with, voice chat and everything, and was busting my ass off with laughter from dumb stuff while playing on maps like Vertigo, Iceworld and one where everyone was in separate sides on top of a big square with structures and snipers ready for the taking...and anyone that didn't survive the previous round with a sniper on their hand would normally be susceptible to an immediate headshot if they spawned in the line of sight of the other players lol- unfortunately OBS didn't actually record properly the game while playing in fullscreen so only the audio remained :(</p>

                 <details><summary><strong>One Piece Netflix ended, Thrill Drive 3 played, and Castlevania Fighter frog co-op completed</strong></summary>
                    <p>I'm writing this at 2am, no cap. Ended up wanting to try Thrill Drive 3 for the first time out of nowhere and spent a while finding the right guides to set up the emulator properly, getting files I needed for the game, aaaaaand waiting for the compressed 40GB HDD file to decompress even though it was around 700MB when compressed...but at least everything finally worked well together, and the game somehow runs fullspeed more reliably than the first game in MAME.</p>
                    
                    <p>This game is hilariously unhinged with how the cars crashing can go flying in many spectacular ways- including yours if you happen to run head first into another one...or even a train. Though sometimes you might bump behind or in front of cars for a moment and somehow you won't be destroyed, though sometimes you can also experience a nuclear explosion inside you car if you poke a curbside too hard. I COMPLETED USA AND EUROPE IN FIRST PLACE, NOW I'M SUFFERING WITH JAPAN- TWO HOURS LATER AAAND ITS DONEEEEEEEEE</p>
                    
                    <p>Now that I actually woke up from sleeping, first thing I stumble upon on Youtube is that SMG4 remade one of his old videos, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yo-w831Gk0" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Freddy's Spaghetteria</a> one...and honestly its cool that I remember a handful of moments from years ago to recognize when there's clearly something with extra budget added to it. Comparing it to the old one in a few moments where I was sure the jokes had to be newer than the original...there's also some stuff that does feel better thanks to it lol</p>
                    
                    <p>I watched the final episode of the Netflix One Piece adaptation with my brother and its honestly cool how you can see enlargened these motifs and hints of bigger things to come later on in the story, mainly from how it could be made with a big budget show production and the huge advantage of foresight about how things would keep going in the anime and manga. Pretty cool; no idea if they would have the budget and time to keep that going further beyond a second season with how the story is way longer than that, but I will be looking forward to said second season.</p>
                    
                    <p>Right after that, I got visited by an old friend, good ol' Atomic Commander (a.k.a. John Silver...yes, like the Treasure Island guy) and I got him to try Thrill Drive 3, laughed over it, he laughed over my attempts after him where I kept crashing out of nowhere on my no-accident attempts...and then we completed Castlevania Fighter in co-op while we both played as the Frog (THAT THING HITS HARD FOR A JOKE CHARACTER); only dying once to the Aguni boss who for the first time did NOT freeze on my PC when playing and caught us off guard. Otherwise, no continues and even Dracula was done through in one go.</p>
                    
                    <p>After some minutes of playing against him in the Versus mode of that game, losing almost always to him as the Frog even when I played as Richter, the Skeleton with the SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS theme playing, Duke Nukem, or even the Frog itself...we finally played SFIII 3rd Strike again after weeks if not months.</p>
                    
                    <p>Okay so where was I at....oh yeah-</p>
                    
                    <p>My dad just told me that he happened to call a cousin of his that he hadn't heard of in over 30 years, having last seen her back when he was at the last grade of high school when he lived in another city...and he currently had 33 years of graduating as an accountant. He also showed me a video on TikTok where a huge anaconda was crossing a street while the cars were stopped for it to keep going.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tomorrow there's gonna be a Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tournament in the mall on the city where I live; its frmo a local Smash Bros. community that has hosted other Smash Bros. Ultimate tournaments before (five to be exact, and I was lucky to be able to assist to all of them), but this is the first one that's gonna be for a non-Smash game AND will be featuring a place to play Just Dance as well. It sure sounds like its gonna be a long day tomorrow, specially when I will likely be even more nervous while locked-on to the races since it is much more likely that I could win a Mario Kart tournament than a Smash Bros. tournament with how I'm easily outskilled by a handful of other players in there.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh, and the leaderboards for the RRT4 challenge got updated today, <a href="https://twitter.com/SharkaBytes/status/1733531007389671709" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">this is how the leaderboard looks now</a>; currently still sitting on top of the AT leaderboard :)<p>
                    
                    <p>Been thinking to edit something from the TD3 gameplay and the SF3 gameplay, but tomorrow's likely not gonna be it because of...well, the MK8D event, and that is if I don't get sidetracked by doing something with the time I played SA2 multiplayer...or something completely unrelated to all that.</p>
                    
                    <p>Actually ended up editing the first time playing TD3 into a little video...and must have spent one or two hours completely carried away by the nonstop brain engine wanting me to put in several goofy edits to try catch low attention span watchers + the funny (because this game gave me quite the material to get creative lol). Hadn't edited this much for a meme-ish edit in a while, and it doesn't have much gameplay as it does have...particular moments from it, but I think it should be a good one minute starting point to do something similar to that but with the other tracks, since I only used the first USA run I tried and failed.</p>
                    
                    <p>And here it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/RC0rdNMKHpI" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Thrill Drive 3 in a nutshell.</a> I should take a shower and sleep now that I have only 10 hours left before it becomes morning and have to go to the event aaaaaaaaaaaa</p>

                 <details><summary>Birthday doodle for the aguacate, RRT4 time attacking, and ChuChu Rocket online</summary>
                    <p>After days of not drawing something, I did something today for O-Awakate's birthday which was yesterday! At first I thought I would get stumped with the initial sketching from the silhouette due to how I wasn't using a clear reference...but when I decided to just go for it and start drawing the clothing, things happened to click together and got a neat final result to send her :)</p>
                    
                    <p>Also had edited a little video as a gift as well; a mix of the one from last year and something Yakuza themed for right now with the drawing edited in. KIRRRRRRYUCHANNNNNNN</p>
                    
                    <p>I just got around too to playing that Splash Wave Racing challenge of this week celbrating RRT4's 25th anniversary with a Helter Skelter Preset D2 fastest lap challenge. Since I only ever played this in Automatic and there was a separate board for AT players, I decided to give it a go.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SharkaBytes/status/1732887223819739195" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">This is how the leaderboard looked</a> at the time of writing this and trying the challenge, and I had set my goal to beat Zjebedius in first place with his 1'04"175. I had got a 1’04"629 on my first attempt...but then I had to go at least 10 or so more times since I kept either missing out from a substantial enough of a time optimization to beat the record...or I choked and bumped while trying to drift at the inside of a corner. And then I <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcadeStriker/status/1733202124220080182" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">NAILED IT.</a> <strong>Got a 1’03"972.</strong> Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGoKMlYvC64" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">a Youtube version</a> if you would prefer to watch it there instead, but all in all, whether my time will get bested from here to the 11th of December or if it will stay on top..who knows, but that was a good run to go out if you ask me.</p>
                    
                    <p>And yes, I did try playing the MT leaderboard too, but it would take me quite a bit more to practice drifting and keeping up with the gears properly with how I NEVER played Ridge Racer in manual before; its not like Daytona USA where you get an additional boost to your top speed and easier time drifting when you know the gear shift tricks.</p>
                    
                    <p>4pm as of writing this...well, time to give a shot at that snazzy looking new Christmas SAGE demo of Victory Heat Rally!!!<p>
                    
                    <p>First ended up playing two games of ChuChuRocket online, for the first time ever in my life, on HKT3030's stream; couldn't play more as the router was finicky with the port forwarding issues and couldn't play more than those two games...but was lucky to be able to play at all. No such luck when they were playing Planet Ring, but it looked funny as weird as it was to play it with others. And then I tried the VHR demo; took me 3 tries to get Gold in all four races and unlocked the bonus, but failed to ace it...oh well.<p>
                    
                    <p>I think I lost some imaginary braincells again. But I finally tried Sonic Drift 16-bit demo: Big SMK and GBA Crash Nitro Kart vibes but in crispy resolution and arguably easier to get the grasp on for the first time even if I still stumbled on my first two laps. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGIZzP7VpBk" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Finished that I Wanna Test The Game</a> post as well; used a lot of GIFs because that game really does a lot of funny stuff that need to be seen in motion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh, and watched the second episode of Velma (don't worry, Luffy helped me) with my older brother because he asked me to. I can get why the humor and how some things are very on the nose which can easily become annoying for other audiences...but I guess that between our tolerance or being used to that kind of humor, along with how my brother laughing many times made it just the more enjoyable...and that being because of how characters were often dipping into negative IQ than before that at least felt more amusing than what I remember from the first episode. But like with many other things, its not a thing that I would be watching without him lol (also Daniel Dae Kim, which we know from Hawaii 5-0 as Chin Ho Kelly, got mentioned wtf)</p>

                 <details><summary>The Game Awards was boring except for the SEGA announcement</summary>
                    <p>In less than 30 minutes I probably must have to go once again to university because of a mandatory event; still haven't ordered my thoughts much to write here aside from having two or three fleeting ideas for SRB2Kart tracks and rewatching Particular Mushroom's video about Yoshi Story and the 30 Melon Challenge. I used to have that game as a kid and played it many times, but I doubt I want to stick my head in there from how grueling it sounds.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM AT 2AM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Technically a new day, but still haven't slept yet. Saw my university pals today at a event at 5PM, got a super cheap but good hotdog at 18Bs there, and uhh...I did watch The Game Awards with some people from my local Smash community. The SEGA announcement had me screaming, but quite nothing else noteworthy for me to say. You might have noticed that I did something here again, like adding music on top which I did want to have inside the container but for some reason it just made the stuff below vanish, so for now I settled in leaving it up there- THEN I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS A MISSING END OF THE AUDIO TAG AND THAT'S WHY IT WASN'T WORKING WELL IN THAT MOMENT.</p>
                    
                    <p>Obviously fixed now. Enjoy the yosh's tunes.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't know, I just remembered a Pokemon Snap song, the one that plays on the Pokemon Report in the morning and thought it would fit neatly for this journal page; as of this writing though I remembered the XBand and thought it would be cool to use one of the songs with how those are a literal piece of old gaming internet as they were composed for...well, the XBand modem for SNES and Genesis; online gaming for consoles WAY before it was something packaged as an official addon from the Dreamcast onwards and commonplace through Xbox Live and Wi-Fi support on consoles since then. Also, been trying to write something about I Wanna Test The Game, but spending a bit of time doing GIFs of the goofy moments that thing causes as well. I feel like there was more stuff that happened at the day but aside from cleaning and what I wrote above, I feel like stuff might have just vanished on my head sooner than expected. Except for having a power outage at 9PM which had me frustrated thinking that it would be one of those that take 4-5 hours to come back, but it only was gone for 30 minutes. Phew.</p>
                    
                     <p>Oh, and today was O-Awakate's birthday. In the rare case whatever outside forces happen to bring y o u to read this...happy birthday once again!!</p>
                     
                     <p>And by the way, just read your message on the guestbook Sun; thanks for your nice comment with 50 cents of nostalgia for early AOL days :)

                    <p>Tried Sonic Battle R prototype v3 for the first time; the post-race lobby music on the day SLAPS. Turns out its from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGIZzP7VpBk" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Freejack</a> as well.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Whoops, forgot to write here after the day was done. In a nutshell, I had played Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and then SADX Multiplayer with an old friend, then we tried PMEX Remix  again for a few minutes, then he got me to try I Wanna Test The Game on Roblox. Amusing experience, though I still got to beat Sagat. After that, I played Wipeout Pure online through PPSSPP with 4 other players, though I got my bum handed because I tried using the Puma 1 on a game I hadn't played in forever in the Phantom speed. </p>
                    
                    <p>And then at around 11pm, two old friends from high school summoned me to play Terraria on Steam for a good while; they gave me some cool stuff like the Meteorite Armor, a flaming yoyo and a sword that can make stars fall where I click, but I still was dying a lot because I was still a goofy guy that hadn't played in forever going with 5 hearts against monsters that showed up out of nowhere, like that stupid Wyvern that also had got quite a few times my other two more skilled friends. A funny good while after all.</p>

                    <p>A morning to watch Netflix's One Piece Episode 7 and minutes later find out that blueminder's at it again with...something cool related to an emulator. But I might elaborate on it in a few hours or days since he hasn't done the big announcement yet with how it is still in beta testing. Just know that it is a cool, unexpected implementation of a certain feature for a very specific emulator.</p>
                    
                    <p>Didn't have much to talk about until my cousin called me to fix his router, which was configured to use a 3G/4G modem instead of a WAN cable, and just came back as he gave me the ride back home with his PC so that I can back up his stuff then install Windows 10 in his computer, since the time I tried to upgrade his Win7 install didn't work at the end. We talked a bit about the fact that the bread he bought and gave me with a glass of milk happened to be of surprising quality compared to every single french bread (small bread) I've eaten in this whole year, and it felt like I hadn't eaten a bread being made to be that crunchy from the outside but well deno frmo the inside sinde...I think a DECADE. Two and a half of those as well and I was already feeling full as they did fill those properly, a big leap from the usual bags of french bread I had bought nearby before and I often chomped down four or five to not much effect.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Don't have much that I want to talk about last night after that, except for hiw I spent minutes watching my second brother play OOT, fighting Morpha and saying the Water Temple was actually quite simple aside from one thing you needed the ocarina for and a sneaky light switch, though it took him a few tries to beat the boss. We both got impressed with whatever was going on with the Shadow Temple,  but also running around giving the Skull and Spooky Masks as young Link to see if that allowed him to borrow the one of truth, but we had got stuck with where to find the Bunny Hood owner. Was relaxing though we didn't find it by the time I was falling asleep, simce I was surprisingly falling asleep at that point.</p>

                    <p>Watched Better Call Saul's second to last episode of the last season...guess that's how things are coming to a close, huh?</p>
                    <p>Also started checking my Google Drive folders and ended up finding some old 2016 videos of me playing Bomberman Online International, which I had completely forgot since 2019 until now...and the server
                    seemed to be down. At least until I contacted Broomop and turns out it was down for a week, but it was up again. Can't explore that game alone, but was lucky that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hard_pretzel" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Hard_Pretzel</a>, the first new Sonic R enjoyer I have ever met in a while through their video about it, was down for trying it
                    for a few matches, which might as well be the first time in a while someone plays on this long-lasting server in a while. Had written something about that before I got the chance to play it again, but at least that still resulted well despite my doubts.</p>

                    <p>As how <a href="https://youtu.be/z5fVZwb6RyU" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">this video</a> should show, it seems the game still gets funky with showing other players not moving at all if you play with UDP On without portfrowarding, so after switching to UDP Auto, we could play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTYcrTxhfm4" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">a pair of games</a>. Really cool to be able to try this again after so long with someone else (if you are reading this, thank you :D). It is always interesting to think when little fun moments can happen from dipping your head in super old online games, just like how I had some goofy fun a few days ago when playing Half-Life in deathmatch thanks to that being much more active than ever before since the 25th anniversary update.</p>
                    
                    <p>Kind of interesting to use the alt channel I opened for my public video dumpster ever since I thought on leaving my original main channel exclusively for edited stuff instead of a random gameplay of a random
                    game I happened to stumble with, but hey, that's something you can also roam if you wonder what I was sticking my nose into.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh, and here's one thing I just finished.</p>

                                    <p><strong>New article/post on my Wordpress site!</strong> <a href="https://arcadestrikerblog.wordpress.com/2023/12/04/the-fantastic-madness-of-castlevania-fighter/" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">Check it out here.</a></p>
                                    
                    <p>A review of mine about my thoughts on that Castlevania fangame I played around two months ago and had stayed as a draft since then until now...its nice to finally get that one out there; aksi took the chance to link from the end of that to this site for the first time!</p>
                    
                    <p>Day's halfway over so I might or might not update entry today later on at night, since I'm unsure whether I'll have something interesting to talk about or not...but hey, another update to the Neocities site, another inch closer to actually having others read this when unveiled.</p>
                    
                    <p>A few hours later, its almost 7PM here and I had been sniffing on my Google Drive folders further...and I've found some interesting old stuff: From stuff I recorded when I still had my N64 and played with friends
                    back in high school, to stuff I had drawn and Game Maker stuff I had created which I didn't expect to still exist, to even something about Google Buzz that...tracked all my likes and comments from my oldest
                    Youtube account/channel that I used as a kid. It is weird to realize that was a thing now, and yet it is sort of neat to have an accurate timeline of what I was looking up back in the day considering it dates all the way back to 2011, from looking up texture pack replacements for Project64 and using Kaillera to play Tekken 3 online...to apparently watching how to create your own Ares skin and a video called "MJ vs SB In... Know It All Jepidy!"...I have no idea what the latter thing is and not even glancing over the timeline gives me a sudden memory of watching it. Oh, and found a kinda embarassing video for high school intended for an anti-drug PSA assignment; had a mini chase with Eternal Champions CD music at one moment and back then I remember the few of us involved actually trying to write a follow up to that with the plot thickening from the resurfacing of the drug victim into...finding something IDK, some action scenes and even a stinger at the end with the cop that arrested the dealer and the victim in the first video being shown in a phone call confirming an exchange of material between him and a new villain in the shadows.</p>
                    
                    <p>We never actually got around to filming something...but it is amusing that I actually had that flashbang of a flashback after I started writing about having found the old video.</p>
                    
                    <p>ALSO THE ABOUT ME PAGE IS FINALLY LIVE AND MY HANDS ARE CRAMPED FROM WRITING SO MUCH IN ONE SITTING WOOOOOOOOARGHHHHHHHHHHH- and now there's a Guestbook page as well for whoever's reading to drop their comment.

                    <p>And the kicker of today's night, at least for now, is finally playing Wipeout Pulse for the first time in my life online...which went surprisingly smooth, even if my driving wasn't as smooth most of the time. Shoutouts to dRoastedCat for being the one that played with me after I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7XDY0ud_iw" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">his video</a> of Wipeout Pulse in 2023 and reached out to him to race as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh, and I finally watched the final episode of the final season of Better Call Saul. It's Saul gone, man. But gonna be fun to get my brother to watch Nobody and imagine it is the next thing after lol</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> Played more The R-Zone at the end as well...this time I got karted more than I would liked.</p>
                    
<hr class="rounded">
                
                    <h1>December 3, 2023</h1>
                    <p>Finally got around to opening the Journal page. Should update this whenever I feel like sharing some stuff about the day...because this page is gonna be a journal, you know.</p>
                    <p>Will be fun to share this site when I do have at least this linked to the main page and having polished said page in the first place, because it is cool to have this little corner
                    where I can write and add stuff to without being bound by character limits or the pressure of feeling like talking to a wall whenever I share little stuff that "seems" ignored on
                    the previously-known-as-the-bird-site. Just me and my little hut where I can drop my two cents about the goofy ahh things I saw in a day because that's how things can just go in a normal day.</p>

                    <p> First news of new stuff, I just watched Better Call Saul's Episode 11 of Season 6, which...wow, that was sure an interesting mix of flashbacks to "the future" and the future. That guy doing THAT thing with
                    their target wheb neither of the other twodidn't want to do because of moral principles is kinda telling how off the rail he has gone, even though it seems implied so far that the little call he had and what he heard on it that we don't know yet must have something to do with it. Also, THAT second guest character's voice sounds real deep now compared to what came before, wow.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also stumbled upon this video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V44Asd8l-b8" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">TOOBOU: Mario Sunshine's Unstoppable Speedrunner</a> and I'm 10 mins in but so far its pretty cool. Last night I also stumbled upon this video when looking up for someone having explained about Rave Racer's 370km/h glitch because its such an insane thing that you can just stumble upon with without any context if you watch MARUBAKU's and GKK-ROD's videos of Rave Racer. Video in question is <a href="https://youtu.be/aF1RW0MTujA?si=Pm_AJCJxwoOj6R0r" target="_blank" class="keychainify-checked">How Rave Racer was Broken by the Japanese Players</a>.</p>
                    
                    <p>...Huh. That's a lot I've written so far for less than half of a day. Guess that's what the fun of your little Neocities corner does to ya.</p>
                    <p><strong>[ADDENUM FROM THE DAY AFTER]</strong> A friend also showed up to take a walk and gave me an ice cream...I was feeling kind of anxious and odd that evening but that helped me out :)</p>
                    <p>I also played some more of a beta F-Zero mod for SRB2Kart which I will likely elaborate more on or share the link whenever its released, but just know that it is pretty hectic
                    as it is right now. Oh, and tried the Hornet ATMT mod as well...and holy moly macaroni that thing's uncontrollable.</p>
