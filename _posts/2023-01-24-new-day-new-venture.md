# Good morning!

*Oh, how I always loved that song, Sonic Rush Adventure is still one of the few games I've 100% completed with all missions and everything (yes, I had the Golden Sonic statue) up to this day...*

Wait, where as I? 

Oh, right.

It is 8:30am as of starting writing this, and I have thankfully been on a substantially better mood because of being given a more promising treatment for a certain predicament I had been carrying for over 7 months already (but most importantly because of something recent from days ago that now looks better after getting checked out).

I woke up early because I have to take pills every 8 hours for this treatment, and since I decided to take the ones for last night at 10am...I got up at 6am. But hey, it feels interestingly refreshing to get up this early and take a shower this soon as well.

*...okay I do have to prep something for breakfast yet but*

With that said, here's what I've been up to recently, not only for this morning but for this month overall!

(9:40am status: Rice with butter lol)

## Nothing more fun than playing with friends

I made a poll last night over my main Youtube channel on whether people would like to see raw gameplay uploads instead of exclusively focusing on montages that take days if not at least over a week to finish over stuff I want to show...and from what I've seen today, people are fine with that!

So I took the chance to make public a batch of [Fighting EX Layer matches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrqK0IcpDsE) I played with a good friend Maniack (which I've played a lot of fighting games with, alongside another good pal Atomic Commander) two weeks ago, and on that note, happened to take the chance as well of adding timestamps to the matches I had with them in [Street Fighter EX3 in last December](https://youtu.be/DtgTEwPe1AM).

Nowadays I feel like most fighting games I need to play them with someone else to really get the most enjoyment out of, specially MUGEN builds cobbled together between us, since the AI and the character balance can be...quite unbalanced at times, but that kind of chaos is what can bring some insane laughs from playing it together.

I also had recorded some matches from a lot of other games with them, some of which I've been recently turning into montages, like this PMEX Remix one.

Oh, and that whole deal about montages these past weeks is something that I actually talked wrote about before but in [another website](https://peakd.com/hive-140217/@acstriker/a-month-of-gaming-and-silly-meme-montages-megaman-zero-dbz-smash-bros-and-more-engesp), which should give you a brief summary of most stuff I did like that recently.

There's also the Hyper Breakers channel I had started last month, which I had planned for edited videos for video essays, though I definitely have to figure out what would be the next thing to do with it after having started with a Street Figther EX video.

Working with Kdenlive has been a learning experience, though I do wonder if I'll ever go back to VEGAS for the sake of efficiency or if I'll stick to Kden with the new famliarity and some things that are easier to do with it.

I also documented some of that in that [other website](https://peakd.com/hive-106817/@acstriker/mi-experiencia-con-un-editor-de-videos-gratuito-pero-sorprendentemente-completo-con-funciones-kdenlive) as well; there's some stuff that I've talked about in there between being the place that I used for more casual writing about anything I did...plus needing some income since I live in Venezuela; it ain't easy to keep the boat afloat here if you get what I mean.

## Stuff I've watched this month

Yeah.

---

#### Jesse and the learning process of COOKING

Before you say anything, first...let him cook.

Okay, *maybe* first actually let him learn to cook before letting him cook.

I started watching the first season of Breaking Bad with my brother, and while I still have to watch the last episode out of that, the previous six episodes of it have been a true rollercoaster. It is quite easy to see now why so many people regard Breaking Bad as well as they do, though the only thing that makes it even odder is to see certain quotes and scenes that you would remember...because of memes.

I mean, this scene where Skyler shows up at Jesse's house where he almost gets caught handling a bag with...something inside, it feels weird to watch if you had already seen THAT meme that used the audio from said scene before; though watching it with the real context somehow made it even crazier just from reailzing how that dude must have been REALLY afraid from being caught hands on the (literal) crime.

"BUT HER NAME IS SKYLER WHITE YO-"

ALRIGHT I GET IT

Also be careful of looking up Breaking Bad stuff on Youtube if you haven't finished it; its just too easy to get spoilers thrown in the face just because of how some of them also happened to turn into ridiculously widespread memes.

Walter going from frustrated man to **H e i s e n b e r g** is truly an experience, though it also gets me thinking on how bad thinks are likely going to get real fast in the following seasons...oh wait there's FIVE seasons. It surely will be a long but arduous ride to get to the end of everything, but at least it is something to watch on the absence of The Boys.

*cough*

Speaking of...

#### The Boys Season 3

If you can watch the series, then do it. If you can stand the crude way its presented (though blamed you won't be if you look away from certain scenes, like *that one infamous scene at the beginning of this season*), then you'll find a surprisingly hooking story that leaves you like "WAIT NOW WHAT'S NEXT"...

...and that's where I am right now. Recapping Season 3 and what I thought on it from watching its events is difficult considering all the context from previous seasons + spoilers, but what I can say is that it was a wild, WILD watch from the 8 episodes of it. And now we'll have to wait for that (and the Gen V spinoff) to be continued...

Oh, and I also watched The Boys Diabolical; I wouldn't say "terrible" (though the second episode really felt like "superpowered teens kill their parents while they look like Rick and Morty"...because it is, so you could say that one wasn't really great), but definitely more often weird than not (who cooked the anime episode with the girl befriending her dung). But it can also be either pure "The Boys" moment with the comic-based stories, surprisingly wholesome or at least trying to tell a story (the sixth episode was truly something unexpected for this series), or giving some extra backstory on the characters from the series instead of showing a thing from the comics.

And if it sounds confusing, you'll be able to tell from the designs, don't worry (if it isn't just straight up shown at the beginning).

Okay so...THE ONE PIECE IS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

---

#### One Piece tried to piece me together

One Piece is something that I started catching up fast over the past two months, more often when I'm not at home and needed to do something to spend time while waiting for something and had my phone handy. Going from Alabasta where I had left off a few months, up to today where I still haven't kept reading too much after finishing Dressrosa, but

KING
KONG
GUN

left a very fun impression on me. Sucks to hear that the anime padded that out, but there's people that cut it down to the one hit KO it always should have been.

Anyways, some panels I've taken screenshots of are pretty cool, some from the worlds, some from the characters arrival or cool poses, some from the covers for specific chapters...and sometimes...just taking photos of anytime I see a silly screaming face. Because if you thought Oda was over with his Enel face (aka "DAMN DANIEL UH UH UH UH UH UH")...then you'd be wrong. Really, really wrong.

But hey, Oda's clearly a dude that loves to throw in silly stuff (Luffy's existence and most names being puns but in Japanese are proof of this), and yet it happens to be enticing in some way when you get hooked on it. Water Seven to Enies Lobby was a REALLY engaging ride, getting to read what lead to the timeskip and after the timeskip was quite cool, and while there was a lot of waiting on Dressrosa, getting to see the story of Law develop (as well as see this dude, Doflamingo, get his just desserts) as well as learning more about characters that we still had to see after the timeskip.

Oh, and the "ONE PIECE IS REAL" part is definitely better in the Anime with how its shown; good on you Pierrot for actually improving that lol

Also no, I'm NOT watching the anime in its entirety for obvious reasons, at best I'd check out the fights in their animated forms, and *maybe*, just *maayyyyybe* watch the movies remaking some of the earliest arcs not only for the updated animation...but also because they are movies, so they wouldn't take a bazillion of filler episodes to get where it should.

I watched One Piece Film RED before all of this though, and that movie was a fun watch, really good music, and if anything, reading the manga to recognize characters I didn't know before but that I had seen in the movie is quite interesting (like the CP0 peeps; funnier to see that they had to cooperate with the Straw Hats in it when you know their actual story with them).

---

#### Trigun and Trigun Stampede

Trigun is not about three guns. Or well, at least not from where I had got to at this point. Had watched the original anime up to the 14th episode a few years ago IIRC, and only recently started rewatching it (two episodes so far). A fun ride like I remembered.

That's because I also started watching the (as of right now, airing) Trigun Stampede, which is not the exact vibe as the original Trigun...but I've also liked it a lot with what it does. Vash might be more of a "I FORGOT MY BULLETS HELP MEEEEEEE" than a "whoops I forgot my bullets, buh-bye", but the redesigns as well as how different the ambientation is does mean that they should be taken as different experiences altogether, even though I consider both of them pretty good to watch.

## The website

...You are reading on it right now. But if you missed the introduction, you can take a look at it on the main list of posts or where it's linked in the "About" page. You know, this is not a Wordpress site or a Wix site or anything, but instead done with Github Pages and that Type on Strap theme using Jekyll.

Again, was sort of confusing to setup as a first-timer, but its cool to have this in a way where I can test stuff offline before PUSHING IT TO THE LIMIIIIIIIIIT- I mean, online, to where you are reading it right now.

I still have to add more projects to that page and such, but it has been an interesting experience altogether, and specially one where I could feel sort of invested just to write my thoughts and such in here without really having to think about why, since it IS a place specifically for any of my hijinks (instead of being a place I had already dedicated to interviews and articles that is [Arcadex Machina](https://arcadestrikerblog.wordpress.com/), which would make me feel odd about using it as the personal dumpster with that in consideration).

And while I did think on testing some of those to migrate them here...there's definitely some benefits that Wordpress offers that I wouldn't turn down for the purpose of what Arcadex Machina is, like the block editors, hosting and easy link embedding, etc...but at least the simpler approach that this more manual setup provides here is good for editing and verifying posts quickly thanks to the local server, as well as even making me feel more engaged to an extent due to how it works.

At least the whole Jekyll/Type on Strap stuff happens to automatize this for the most part (I write in .md files that are like templates converted into pages by Jekyll) so that it isn't building a .HTML page with typing all the nitty gritty details they need each time...

## So...what now?

Rice with butter.

*I wanted to embed it but seems that Youtube says "no" because of the song being copyrighted. Another day, another bummer with Youtube, I guess.*

That's it for this spontaneous burst of blog for now, but I can name a few things that I've also seen recently

- More eurobeat (GET ME POWERRRRR)
- Megaman Zero Collection's Easy Scenario is so stupid easy its silly, yet satisfying to play in some way just to tear through the levels without having to wait an eternity for spikes or grinding moves, at least for Zero 1
- Shoutouts to: [Drum & Bass Video Games Mix](https://youtu.be/B2JHChJpG_A), it even has Deadly Arts, Tetrisphere and 1080° Snowboarding in it!!
- [Speaking of cool music...](https://youtu.be/pUYxYdbnwQI)
- If you are reading this, I hope you're having a nice day, and thanks for reading!
- Currently trying out Firefox after a good while of using Microsoft Edge
- Time to push this into the Github...I need to rest after squeezing my brain this much just for this "nothingburger" of a half-day update, see you next time!
