# Hey there! Check this out!

#### You might be wondering what all of this is about (if you are even reading this in first place).

I spent a couple of days trying to learn how to do this with the Type on Strap template for Jekyll and GitHub Pages after finding a website that used this one website, and then trying to make a new site in stuff like Wix and Google Pages...only to feel somewhat unsatisfied with the speed and way I had to build stuff.

And that's why you're reading this on my "thearcadestriker.github.io" URL! That was my Github username (as I had made the account before simplifying to the "ACStriker" you know today; yes that's what the "AC" stands for and I would prefer to be called "Striker" for short instead of "ACS" lol) and you're reading at this on my Github pages setup, pushed to you with Jekyll and Github Desktop!!

Now while there's a reason why I'm not completely joyful while writing this (which is not related to the site or anything, but over soemthing health-related as of wrigin this; hopefully resolved or at least mitigated by tomorrow or soon...), it is really cool to have my own website hosted as well as trying to learn the ropes on how to use this Jekyll/Type on Strap theme. It definitely has something quite accessible in writing on .md files for posts (blog-style) and templates so that I can organize it in any way I wish.

Flexibility over what pages to make and show is likely there but something that I would have to learn in another occasion, but for now I'm looking forward to add the stuff that has to go where it should, like the projects having their icons and appropiate descriptions for them in that page.

At least my experience with Wordpress and Hive have been useful on knowing the classic text tricks, like separators, *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, italians with a bold attitude...no wait, *I think that's* ***hedgehogs***, aren't they?

It is interesting that at first I considered better to use a website creator over the fact that having stuff instantly available online and automatically saved was there, but I think that there's also something liberating about being able to write my stuff "offline," host a local server to check how it looks immediately from my browser, AND THEN decide to push any particular changes into the online website through Github Desktop. 

A surprisingly nifty approach that I'm willing to stick with thanks to the cool new commodities presented here.

While I still have to add more as of right now, there's a page for SRB2Kart ArcadePak in the projects page already (more to be added later), and if you haven't noticed it yet, there's a very handy dark theme button in the top right corner.
